It started with an innocent looking four-letter initialism.

> BCFS

Their website describes what they do as "a global system of health and
human services non-profit organizations," but a Wayfair employee
recognized them as one of the organizations running modern-day
concentration camps. After management rejected their requests out of
hand, Wayfair employees walked out for several hours in protest.

Less than a week after the sale to BCFS was spotted internally, hundreds
of employees acted as one as the nation watched. How did this come to
pass? Let's look closer.

---

The person who discovered the sale to BCFS quickly spread the word to
their colleagues—about 2 dozen. They drafted a letter with two specific
asks of Wayfair's management. The full letter was
[posted on Twitter](https://twitter.com/sun_daiz/status/1143548274240102401);
let's break down how it was written and why—so we can learn from it in
case we need to write our own letter like this.

![Paragraph 1](/images/wayfair-1.jpg)

The opening paragraph is straight and to the point without using
(excessively) inflammatory language. It clearly communicates the
emotions involved without letting them bleed into the words used. It
offers citations for its strongest claims—some might dispute the use of
the term "atrocities," and it preempts them by offering examples. This
introduction sets the stage for the rest of the letter, explaining who
is speaking and what issues they're speaking about.

If I were asked to edit this, I might have changed it to,

> We, the <ins>\<number of signatures\></ins> undersigned, are writing
> to you from a place of concern and anger about <ins>Wayfair's role
> in</ins> the atrocities being committed at our Southern border. The
> United States government and its contractors are responsible for the
> detention and mistreatment of hundreds of thousands of migrants
> seeking asylum in our country <del>-- we want that to end</del>. We
> ~~also~~ want to be sure that Wayfair has no part in enabling,
> supporting, or profiting from this practice.

Immediately sharing the number of people that have signed the letter
helps sell the the weight rest of its contents, assuming it's a high
number—in this case, 547 seems high to me. I'd also emphasize the focus
on what Wayfair controls—I too want the atrocities to end, but Wayfair
doesn't have leverage to make that happen, so it distracts from the main
request.

![Paragraph 2](/images/wayfair-2.jpg)

Emphasizing that this isn't the first occurrence ups the ante
significantly. The footnote explains that BCFS's first purchase of
Wayfair's products were used at a camp that was later found to be
substandard. This increases the veracity of the claims: BCFS isn't
assumed to be a bad actor by association with detention, there is
evidence of their own bad behavior. However, I feel this lede is buried
by putting it in a footnote. Comparatively, the UN statement on child
rights violations feels abstract; an international governing body is
several levels of importance away from a furniture retailer.

![Paragraph 3](/images/wayfair-3.jpg)

Solidly bringing it back to Wayfair's own ideals, a VP of B2B sales is
quoted directly. Using an executives own words in support of your cause
is powerful—Wayfair can't dispute the message, it's from one of their
own. This paragraph short, punchy, and brings neatly measures their
complaints against the business' aspirations.

![Paragraph 4](/images/wayfair-4.jpg)

Finally, the asks. They're limited in scope and accomplishable. It's a
combination of rectifying a wrong and making an organizational change to
prevent the wrong from reoccuring. They're directly related to a recent
event within the company, and were presented in a timely manner. Truly
commendable.

This letter is fantastically written, and the asks are reasonable. And
yet:

> We believe all of our stakeholders, employees, customers, investors,
> and suppliesrs included, are best served by our commitment to fulfill
> all orders.

[Management's response](https://twitter.com/FizFashizzle/status/1143530739541139457),
delivered the next day, is a flat no.

Thus the walkout. Less than four days after management's response,
hundreds of Wayfair employees walked out, joined (both in person and
online) by other tech workers in solidarity. The build up the day before
received national attention, including from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and
Bernie Sanders.

First they complained. Then they demanded action. Management declined,
and the employees were prepared.

Let's take a look at what that preparation looked like.

### Early 2019

Concerns raised to management after the first sale to BCFS. No action
from management was taken.

Here lay an opportunity for the seeds of workplace organizing to take
root. A network of like-minded folks throughout the company can make
contact with each other when complaints like this are raised. Talking to
your coworkers about this is hard, but it's the first step towards
organized action.

### June 19th

A second sale to BCFS is spotted and disseminated. A meeting is planned
for the next day, where asks are decided upon and a letter is drafted.
Almost certainly, this is where the walkout was first proposed—A
contingincy in case an agreement couldn't be reached.

### June 21st

A digital copy of the letter is circulated internally, with a link to an
external form used to "sign" it. After about 4 hours, the organizers
deliver it to management.

### June 24th

Management responds in the negative.

### June 25th
