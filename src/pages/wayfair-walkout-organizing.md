At 1:30pm on Wednesday, June 26th, hundreds of Wayfair employees walked
out of the office after failing to reach an agreement with Wayfair's
executives about furnishing an ICE detention center.

What I wanted to know is, how does a walkout happen? What is the
sequence events that begins with somebody sharing an opinion and ends
with hundreds of people risking their livelihood?

Largely pieced together from
[an interview done with Vice](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/a3x84z/wayfair-is-profiting-from-immigration-detention-so-im-walking-out),
I've put together a rough timeline. I'm filling in gaps to the best of
my ability, but I haven't been able to make direct contact with anyone
involved in organizing the walkout.

### Early 2019

A worker at Wayfair sees a sale to BCFS, a contractor for ICE with a
reputation for sub-standard facilities, and an unknown number of people
raise concerns management. No action was taken.

I'd bet that the genesis of the walkout could be traced here. All the
ingredients are here; like-minded folks throughout the company came
together with a shared complaint, and management took no action in
response. Organized actions begin with a few people talking, and if they
didn't already know each other, this is likely when they started
collaborating.

My questions for the organizers at this point:

- Did you already know a group of coworkers who were opposed to this
  type of sale? How did you reach out to them about this sale?
- How did you know to look for BCFS?

### June 19th

A second sale to BCFS is spotted and disseminated, reportedly to a group
of about 24 coworkers throughout the company. This group meets the next
day to draft a letter to management with 2 specific requests.
[The letter](https://twitter.com/sun_daiz/status/1143548274240102401) is
so well composed and thoroughly cited that I have to assume it wasn't
written from scratch in 1 day. That, more than anything, makes me think
that significant effort was put into planning this walkout in the months
between sales to BCFS.

I feel this letter, as the primary contact between a large group of
employees and the company's owners, is one of the most important tools.
Further down I break down and offer my analysis of what they've written.
I have a tiny bit of experience here—I helped draft
[a letter](https://github.com/palantir/blueprint/pull/3535/files?short_path=2f4c358#diff-2f4c3585a94a03c11192c3ae940fcb70)
attempting to
[convince Palantir employees to resist ICE](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/13/tech-workers-palantir-immigration-protest-github)
contract renewal from the inside.

Almost certainly, the meeting on the 20th was where the walkout was
concretely decided upon—a contingency in case an agreement couldn't be
reached.

My questions:

- How much planning happened in advance of this meeting?
- What were your guiding principles when writing the letter?

### June 21st

A digital copy of the letter is circulated internally, with a link to an
external form used to digitally sign it. After about 4 hours, the
organizers deliver it to management with 547 signatures. For a company
of about 7000 people, that seems like an impressive percentage to get
signatures from so quickly.

My questions:

- How did you spread the letter across the company?
- Why did you send the letter quickly rather than let it cirulate
  longer?

### June 24th

[Management responds, negatively](https://twitter.com/FizFashizzle/status/1143530739541139457).
They "appreciate your passion and commitment," and are "proud to have
such an engaged team," but decline to actually do anything in response.
After news of the walkout broken, they walked that back from a flat no
to
[donating \$100k](https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/26/business/wayfair-donation-migrant-facility/index.html)
to the Red Cross—not to [RAICES](https://www.raicestexas.org), an
immigrant rights group, as requested. At the walkout, workers argued
that the money should be used to support the affected community.

### June 25th

Tuesday morning, the management response
[was tweeted](https://twitter.com/FizFashizzle/status/1143530739541139457).
Later that day, it became a national issue with
[AOC](https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1143590995122171905) and
[Bernie Sanders](https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/1143610481854300161)
tweeting in support of it.

### June 26th

Workers walk out.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It was awesome to see the turnout today. Thank you to everyone who showed up to the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WayfairWalkout?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WayfairWalkout</a> <a href="https://t.co/x4oUttSv9i">pic.twitter.com/x4oUttSv9i</a></p>&mdash; wayfairwalkout (@wayfairwalkout) <a href="https://twitter.com/wayfairwalkout/status/1144013585586126848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 26, 2019</a></blockquote>

It's hard to get a count, and it's hard to know how many in the crowd
are Wayfair employeers vs friends of the walkout showing solidarity, but
this looks like a big turnout to me. Direct actions like this are risky,
so Tech Workers Coalition
[set up a hotline](https://mobile.twitter.com/techworkersco/status/1144039406292127744)
in case any workers face retaliation.

## Tearing apart the letter to management

The full letter these workers submitted to management was
[posted on Twitter](https://twitter.com/sun_daiz/status/1143548274240102401).
This is a great artifact of a successful protest, and I'd like to break
down how it was written and why to learn how to write something similar.

The most important thing when writing, I've found, is to have a clear
idea of who I'm speaking to and what I want them to take away from it.
The audience here is obvious: management, specific individuals that the
authors probably know, at least by reputation. What should they take
away from it? From their previous behavior, it's clear that they don't
agree that it's wrong to accept money from BCFS. It's hard to change
somebody's mind, especially when they have a financial interest in
staying the course. Let's look at each paragraph and guess at how
Wayfair's leadership might perceive it.

### Paragraph 1

![Paragraph 1](/images/wayfair-1.jpg)

The opening paragraph is straight and to the point without using
(excessively) inflammatory language. It clearly communicates the
emotions involved without letting them bleed into the words used. It
offers citations for its strongest claims—some might dispute the use of
the term "atrocities," and it preempts them by offering examples. This
introduction sets the stage for the rest of the letter, explaining for
whom it speaks and what issues they're speaking about.

However I think some parts of this might be poorly received by a leader
within Wayfair. If I were asked to edit this, I might have changed it
to,

> We, the <ins>547</ins> undersigned, are writing to you from a place of
> concern and anger about <ins>Wayfair's role in</ins> the atrocities
> being committed at our Southern border. The United States government
> and its contractors are responsible for the detention and mistreatment
> of hundreds of thousands of migrants seeking asylum in our country
> <del>-- we want that to end</del>. We ~~also~~ want to be sure that
> Wayfair has no part in enabling, supporting, or profiting from this
> practice.

Immediately sharing the number of people that have signed the letter
helps sell the the weight rest of its contents, assuming it's a high
number—in this case, 547 seems high to me. I'd also emphasize the focus
on what Wayfair controls—Wayfair has no leverage to end the atrocities,
so it distracts from the main request.

### Paragraph 2

![Paragraph 2](/images/wayfair-2.jpg)

Emphasizing that this isn't the first occurrence ups the ante
significantly. The footnote explains that BCFS's first purchase of
Wayfair's products were used at a camp that was later found to be
substandard. This increases the veracity of the claims: BCFS isn't
assumed to be a bad actor by association with detention, there is
evidence of their own bad behavior.

However, I feel the lede has been buried in a footnote. Comparatively,
the UN statement on child rights violations feels abstract; a statement
by an international governing body condemning child detention is much
less immediate than information that their customer has previously put
children at risk.

### Paragraph 3

![Paragraph 3](/images/wayfair-3.jpg)

Solidly bringing it back to Wayfair's own ideals, a VP of B2B sales is
quoted directly. Using an executives own words in support of your cause
is powerful—Wayfair can't dispute the message, it's from one of their
own. This paragraph short, punchy, and brings neatly measures their
complaints against the business' aspirations.

### Paragraph 4

![Paragraph 4](/images/wayfair-4.jpg)

Finally, the asks. They're limited in scope and accomplishable. It's a
combination of rectifying a wrong and making an organizational change to
prevent the wrong from reoccuring. They're directly related to a recent
event within the company, and were presented in a timely manner.

---

### Management's response

This letter is fantastically written, and the asks are reasonable. And
yet:

> We believe all of our stakeholders, employees, customers, investors,
> and suppliers included, are best served by our commitment to fulfill
> all orders.

[Management's response](https://twitter.com/FizFashizzle/status/1143530739541139457),
delivered the next day, is a flat no.

Thus the walkout. It offers a good reminder: It's not enough to complain
if your company is doing something that its workers feel is wrong. If
complaints aren't met with change, it must escalate to action.
